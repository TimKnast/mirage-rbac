Currently perceived challenges in cue form

- Online update of policies - feasible?
  - could hash query/capabilities and permit policy changes that operate (exclusively) on existing data structures. This code would be uploaded to the RBAC domain.
  - Allowing online updates could cause versioning issues with cached queries on the client sid
  - could have domain unikernel send policy on boot, but that would allow compromised domains (ie hacked *nix domains) to upload code to the RBAC, so hardly advisable? (unless we sign the policy?)
    - alternatively have the code that starts the domain from dom0 do it
      - with this approach only client needs restarting

- Identity management external to domains
  - Update authentication tokens, delete or create identities, ..?)

- inter-domain trust? Allow one domain policy to query other domains? (mapping id<-> id using User record)
  - need to investigate benefits and implications of permitting this

- Policy language
  - Propose required operations
  - Query "flags":
    - "Can I?" / Lookahead / "Don't Log"
      - Semantic difference between inquiring about the legality of an action and performing it
        - example: "can I edit this page" / "now I'm editing, here's the new content"
        - Two different queries or add flag to query? (need to prevent code cloning, but may not want to log mere probes)
