== mirage-rbac
A role based access control system that provides a centralized solution for logging and policy marshalling.
The system is _cooperative_; the client domains query the RBAC for decisions and are expected to honor them, but the RBAC doesn't forcefully restrict actions inside the client domain.
The system provides authentication services that domains can use to quickly and safely implement usernname/password-systems or authenticate users or remote servers based on public key cryptography.
The system enables the clients to make _queries_, using parameterized variants, to which the system responds with a positive or negative boolean _decision_.
The decisions are the outcome of domain _policies_, limited programs that compare queries to the capability set held by its current session and return a decision.
Each policy item is called a [decision handler] and can be one of three types: 1) DSL/hosted code uploaded to the system 2) System-provided code, for authentication services etc.
  3) Domain callbacks; code inside the domain that responds with (?data or a yes/no?) for the RBAC to consider
A decision handler can issue queries of its own.
